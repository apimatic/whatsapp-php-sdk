    "description": "Welcome to the WhatsApp API from Meta.  Individual developers and existing Business Service Providers (BSPs) can now send and receive messages via the WhatsApp API using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business API. Compared to the previous solutions, the cloud-based WhatsApp API is simpler to use and is a more cost-effective way for businesses to use WhatsApp. Please keep in mind the following configurations:  | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | Version | Latest [Graph API version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/). For example: v13.0 | | User-Access-Token | Your user access token after signing up at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com). | | WABA-ID | Your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) ID. | | Phone-Number-ID | ID for the phone number connected to the WhatsApp Business API. You can get this with a [Get Phone Number ID request](3184f675-d289-46f1-88e5-e2b11549c418). | | Business-ID | Your Business' ID. Once you have your Phone-Number-ID, make a [Get Business Profile request](#99fd3743-46cf-46c4-95b5-431c6a4eb0b0) to get your Business' ID. | | Recipient-Phone-Number | Phone number that you want to send a WhatsApp message to. | | Media-ID | ID for the media to [send a media message](#0a632754-3788-43bf-b785-ac6a73423d5a) or [media template message](#439c926a-8a6c-4972-ab2c-d99297716da9) to your customers. | | Media-URL | URL for the media to [download media content](#cbe5ece3-246c-48f3-b338-074187dfef66). |",
